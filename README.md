# Evaluate News Article with Natural Language Processing

This project is part of the Udacity Front-End Developer Nanodegree Program. This project involved setting up webpack and utilizing the Aylien Text API to analyze news articles. 

## Getting started

- `git clone`
- `cd` into your new folder and run:
- `npm install`

## Setting up the API
### Step 1: Signup for an API key
Go [here](https://developer.aylien.com/signup) to sign up for an API key. 

### Step 2: Environment Variables
- [ ] Create a new ```.env``` file in the root of the project
- [ ] Add ```.env```  to the .gitignore file
- [ ] Fill the .env file with your API keys like this:
```
API_ID=**************************
API_KEY=**************************
```

## After the Aylien API
- Go back to the web pack config and add the setup for service workers.  
- Test that the site is now available even when you stop your local server 

## Deploying

A great step to take with your finished project would be to deploy it! Unfortunately its a bit out of scope for me to explain too much about how to do that here, but checkout [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) or [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) for some really intuitive free hosting options.
